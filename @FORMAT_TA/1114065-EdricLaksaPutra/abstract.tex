\chapter*{ABSTRACT}
\noindent The software architecture is a summary that describes the organization standard software process. This architecture outlines reservations, interfaces, interdependencies, and other relationships among the elements the standard organization of software processes [14]. Challenges on research analysis is developing microservice architecture to solve the problem on monolithic architecture on an increasingly large system to keep synergies from the system remains efficient [9]. Examples of cases raised for this study are outpatient system at Apertura Hospital Management Information System. Development of microservice architecture begins with determining the service module which is formed from the decomposition of business processes [6], using database per service pattern [6]. Communication methods between services use RESTful (Representational State Transfer) API with a data format delivered in the form of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) [9] and API methods Composition to perform in-memory join [6]. Testing done with perform comparison comparisons of the way the system works for each parameter test consisting of: level of performance, availability, scalability, and reliability system [10]. Based on the result of testing analysis, microservice architecture can be the solution in solving constraints in monolithic and architecture suitable applied to Apertura system for multiple system development years ahead.
